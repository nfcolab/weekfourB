Here are the commands and their frequencies. Frequency here means that commands with larger numbers are more frequent and therefore used more often and learned faster. Commands with a small frequency take longer to learn, because they are used less. Note that these numbers are abstract but relative: a command with twice the frequency value will be used twice as often, but these numbers are not probabilities because they do not need to sum up to one."

This introduces stochasticity (randomness) to the model. So, if you for instance run the model for 1 hour and then ask how long did it take to learn `ls`, you will get different results upon repeating it. That's a problem! While understandable feature of the model, it means that a single run of the model does not really provide us with robust information.\n",
